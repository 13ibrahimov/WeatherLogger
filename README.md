WeatherLogger is an android app that gives weather information on user's location using OpenWeatherMap API.
It also logs part of that information, namely {request time -> temperature} into Logs.txt file in dir /Download/WeatherLogger.

IMPORTANT NOTE: For any further app development, PLEASE sign up on OpenWeatherMAP and get your own APP KEY,
                and change String APPID variable in APIHandler class to your own key.
